CloudFront â€“ Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that youâ€™re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

Amazon Route 53 â€“ It is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking. If you choose to use Route 53 for all three functions, perform the steps in this order:

STEP 1 â€“ Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a domain name.

STEP 2 â€“ When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (apex.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.

STEP 3 â€“  Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that itâ€™s reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.

        As a Junior Full stack Developer I have had the opportunity to work on real world applications impacting the school sector & cloud based surveillance systems. Utilized the spring boot platform for
developing web sockets or chat communication technologies that connect clients and employees. Utilized modern collaboration tools such as JIRA and GIT (VCS). Assisted in designing project modules (UML) from the BRD and assisted in developing & pushing HTML and CSS code. Hands on experience with the Selenium Framework, STLC, and Amazon Web Service technologies (AWS). Currently I'm in the market for a job opportunity as a Junior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)
